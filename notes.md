1. Different engines have different “codenames”. For example:

V8 – in Chrome and Opera.
SpiderMonkey – in Firefox.
There are other codenames like “Trident” and “Chakra” for different versions of IE, “ChakraCore” for Microsoft Edge, “Nitro” and “SquirrelFish” for Safari, etc.

2. Besides regular numbers, there are so-called “special numeric values” which also belong to this data type: Infinity, -Infinity and NaN.

3. NaN represents a computational error. It is a result of an incorrect or an undefined mathematical operation.

4. The script will never stop with a fatal error (“die”). At worst, we’ll get NaN as the result.

5. Special numeric values formally belong to the “number” type. Of course they are not numbers in the common sense of this word.(NaN,Infinity,-Infinity)

6. In JavaScript, there is no char type. There’s only one type: string. A string may consist of only one character or many of them.

7. In JavaScript, null is not a “reference to a non-existing object” or a “null pointer” like in some other languages. It’s just a special value which represents “nothing”, “empty” or “value unknown”. data type is null.

8. data type of undefined is undefined.
